How to change the branding name on Mikrotik with Branding Package Maker?

Actually this is not a trick, but it is a tool maker that is provided directly on the official Mikrotik website, it's just that maybe many don't know it and indeed, as far as I know, this tool was initially not accessible to the public, but now it seems that it's allowed for all accounts.

The method is very easy:
1. Must have an account on Mikrotik, if not, please register first https://mikrotik.com/client
2. If you have just searched for Branding Maker in the lower left menu and just input the information you need, an example is in the picture.
3. Save with where the *.dpk file is, then download the file to your PC first, then just re-upload the file to Mikrotik. You can use drag and drop file
4. reboot your Router
